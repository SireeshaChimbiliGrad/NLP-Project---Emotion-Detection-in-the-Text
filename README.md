# NLP-Project---Emotion-Detection-in-the-Text
This is a repository for the NLP Semester Project where we dealt with emotion detection in the text using BERT and RoBERTa Pre-trained encoder models and fine-tuned the models for the better performance and compared the model performances of BERT and RoBERTa using different metrics.
